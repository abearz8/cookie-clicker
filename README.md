## Description
This is a learning project for me, the developer, with the goal of practicing documentation practices in the software developing process, and learning how to write next.js and practice using tools such as Cursor and Git repositories.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This web application is based on the famous "Cookie Clicker" game that I grew up playing and wanted to replicate.

## How to run
First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result
